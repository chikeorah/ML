# Machine Learning Models Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that implements and optimizes several machine learning models on a dataset.

## Models Implemented

1. **Linear Regression Model**: This model is used to predict a continuous outcome variable (also called the dependent variable) based on one or more predictor variables (also known as independent variables).

2. **Linear Regression Model Optimized using RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination)**: This is a feature selection method that fits a model and removes the weakest feature (or features) until the specified number of features is reached.

3. **Linear Regression Model Optimized using SVR (Support Vector Regression)**: This model applies the principles of Support Vector Machines to a regression problem. It uses the same concepts like margin and maximum margin.

4. **Random Forest**: This is a versatile machine learning method capable of performing both regression and classification tasks. It is a type of ensemble learning method, where a group of weak models combine to form a powerful model.

5. **Random Forest Optimized using Grid Search**: This model uses Grid Search to find the optimal hyperparameters of a Random Forest model in order to improve its performance.

6. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**: This is a simple and intuitive model that predicts the target of a new instance based on the targets of its 'k' closest instances in the feature space.

7. **k-NN Optimized using Grid Search**: This model uses Grid Search to find the optimal hyperparameters of a k-NN model in order to improve its performance.

8. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: SVMs can model non-linear relationships using the kernel trick, and they work well in high-dimensional spaces.

9. **SVM Optimized using Grid Search**: This model uses Grid Search to find the optimal hyperparameters of an SVM model in order to improve its performance.

10. **XGBoost**: This is an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance.

11. **XGBoost Optimized using Grid Search**: This model uses Grid Search to find the optimal hyperparameters of an XGBoost model in order to improve its performance.

12. **Neural Network Regression (NNR)**: This model uses a neural network for regression tasks. It can model complex, non-linear relationships.

13. **NNR Optimized using Grid Search**: This model uses Grid Search to find the optimal hyperparameters of an NNR model in order to improve its performance.
